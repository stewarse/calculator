Welcome! This is my calculator app that I developed as a part of my journey
through the TOP curriculum. THis will be my first fully functioning app.

What I will be learning/practicing:

- Using event listeners to call functions
- Storing result of the operators and displaying that result on the page
- Chain functions together by allowing users to complete as many calcs as needed

Stretch Goals:

- Using keyboard support
- Allow user to utilize floating point numbers
- Establish a backspace feature that allows a user to clear an errant operand
